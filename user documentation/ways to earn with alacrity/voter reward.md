# Voter Reward

## Overview

> Users earn rewards based on how many coins they have staked when they cast votes.

Users can receive part of the block reward by staking tokens and using them for voting. User rewards are based  off  the  number  of  votes  each  user  cast,  and  every  coin  offers  the  ability  to  vote  once  it  has  been staked for 9 days.

Every 30 days 5% of the total block reward over those 30 days is distributed to addresses who cast votes over that 30 day period. The amount of tokens received is adjusted based on the number of votes over 30 days.

## Requirements
Alacrity relies on its users to cast votes to determine key network decisions. In order to vote users must stake coins for at least 9 days.

Each user can cast up to 1000 votes as long as they have at least 1000 ALA. If a user has more than 1000 ALA they can still only cast 1000 votes, but they will earn financial rewards on the total number of coins even if it exceeds 1000.

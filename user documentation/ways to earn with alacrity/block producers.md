# Block Producers
## Overview
Block Producers receive a reward for providing crucial services to the network. The Block Producers which  contribute  more  resources  receive  a  greater  reward,  but  each  Block  Producer  is  guaranteed  a favorable minimum amount.

## Who can be a Block Producer
Anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks, provided they can persuade token holders to vote for them. Block Producers must stake 100,000 Aladin  in order to be a Block Producers and to be eligible to receive votes. The Alacrity network enables blocks to be produced exactly every 0.5 second and exactly one producer is authorized to produce a block at any given point in time. 

## How Blocks Distribute Rewards
ALA coins are issued through the block reward. The rate of issuance starts at 5% per year and decreases as time goes on until it reaches 2% by the 4th year of operation. <br>
Alacrity uses DPOS (delegated proof of stake) to distribute the block reward. Fifty percent of each block reward goes to the network while the other fifty percent is used for platform development. <br>

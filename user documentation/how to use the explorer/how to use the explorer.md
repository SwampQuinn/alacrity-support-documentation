# How to Use the Explorer

Decentralized blockchains are immutable, which means that the data entered is irreversible. All transactions are public, traceable, and permanently stored in the network.

The Alacrity Explorer is essentially a search engine that allows one to search or browse for a particular piece of information on the blockchain network.

In the Dashboard for example, the most recent blocks produced, Alacrity's Network info, Price/Supply info for ALA, and Recent Transactions can be observed with virtually live updates.

Navigate to specific pages for information about each using the top left menu (Dashboard, Producers, Blocks, Transactions, Audit Trail) or Search for specific data by using the Search bar in the upper right.

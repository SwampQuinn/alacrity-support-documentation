# How Opn Creates Stability

OPN maintains a stable value of $1 by using ETH as collateral and ensuring that all issued coins are “over collateralized”. 

This means that for every $1 of OPN there is at least $2 of ETH backing it. The system then uses a protocol of collateral optimization to prevent any price shocks from negatively impacting OPN.

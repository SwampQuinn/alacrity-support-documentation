# OPN Auction

The OPN Auction function is used to stabilize the value of OPN during any large price moves in the underlying collateral.

Users can place bids using OPN to purchase ETH during any liquidations of batch owners. Buyers are able to acquire ETH at competitive prices, and in doing so stabilize the  system by ensuring that OPNFinance can burn extra OPN to maintain the 1$ peg.

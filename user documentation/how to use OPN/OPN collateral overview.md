# OPN Collateral Overview

OPN uses a higher level of collateralization than other systems (200%) to ensure price stability in OPN. Additionally, it provides instant access to liquidity at all times in order to protect the value of OPN during any sudden price drops.

There are no situations where a user would not be able to liquidate OPN into underlying collateral at any time.

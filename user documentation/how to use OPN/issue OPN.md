## Monitor Collateral
Once the OPN has been collateralized, the user will receive OPN in their wallet.

## Claim Collateral
*At any time users can return their OPN to retrieve their collateral by paying a small claim collateral fee (.5%). These fees are distributed to GVN owners.* 

1. Acquire enough OPN to reclaim collateral. 
2. Go to OPN wallet. 
3. Use claim collateral function. 
4. Send OPN to the contract. 
5. ETH will be deposited in your wallet minus any fees.

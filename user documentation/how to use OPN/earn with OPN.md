# Earn with OPN

OPNFinance allows you to gain utility and revenue from your assets. For example, you can turn your BTC holdings into spendable currency which generates consistent revenue.

Everytime a user transacts with OPN, the Batch owner earns a transaction fee. In other words, OPN Batch Owners earn revenue whenever the coins they issue are used to transact!

> The big vision of OPN is that anyone can issue a stable currency and earn revenue, as it is circulated and used.

Batch owners receive 80% of transaction fees and 80% of any liquidity fees which come from their coins.

**There are a few ways that OPN transactions can create earnings:**
1. Issue OPN and collect transaction fees
2. Have users liquidate your OPN and collect fees
3. Use OPN to purchase other assets while earning fees

# Governance

GVN is The Governance System for a Decentralized Organization that Owns the OPN DAPP. <br>
The Alacrity OPN contract effectively has no keys, as authority is removed from the starting keys and assigned to the GVN account. 

## About GVN

GVN is the governance token of the OPNFinance token protocol. All changes and updates to the OPNFinance protocol are managed by GVN voters. GVN voting is in full control of the platform. GVN also provides revenue to its owners.

**GVN owners earn the following fees from the protocol:**

* 20% of Transaction Fees
* 20% of Liquidity Fees
* 100% of Claim Collateral Fees
* 100% of GVN Capital Investment Contract Revenue
* 80% of all Governance Proposal Fees

GVN tokens are emitted from the GVN contract in exchange for ALA. This is a one way exchange process, you can purchase GVN for ALA but you cannot sell GVN(to the contract).

The value of GVN is Supply +1$. That means for each GVN that is created the cost of emitting 1 GVN increases by 1$. ALA which is spent to purchase GVN becomes part of the GVN Invest contract.

## Governance Proposals
GVN voting is weighted by the number of tokens a voter has vs the total amount of GVN tokens in existence.

## Passing a Governance Campaign
80% of Active voters must vote yes for a proposal to be accepted.

Users automatically Vote no if no vote submitted.

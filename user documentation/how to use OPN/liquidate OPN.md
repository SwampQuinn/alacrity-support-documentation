# Liquidate OPN

Batch owners (the original issuers of OPN) are not the only party that can convert OPN to collateral. Any user can freely convert OPN they obtained on the market into underlying collateral via the 24/7 liquidate function that allows any user to convert any OPN back into ETH at any time.

Using the 24/7 liquidate function charges a 2% fee.

All liquidate fees are distributed 80% to the batch owner and 20% to GVN owners.

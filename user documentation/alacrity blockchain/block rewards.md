# Block Rewards 
Block rewards are newly issued ALA which are created during block creation. They fund a variety of network participants for different reasons.

## How Blocks Distribute Rewards
ALA coins are issued through the block reward. The rate of issuance starts at 5% per year and decreases as time goes on until it reaches 2% by the 4th year of operation.

Alacrity uses DPOS (delegated proof of stake) to distribute the block reward. Fifty percent of each block reward goes to the network while the other fifty percent is used for platform development.

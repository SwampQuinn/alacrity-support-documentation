# Block Producers
Block producers are a set of 21 elected nodes which view transactions and commit them to the chain using a consensus system known as DPOS. 

Block producers are elected by the community, and any block producer who is not part of the top 21 becomes a witness, a backup block producer.

Block Producers run powerful computing equipment which is used to process transactions and execute computation requirements determined by smart contracts.

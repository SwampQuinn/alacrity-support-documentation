# Governance
Alacrity Governance consists of two main systems: Node voting and Governance voting.

## Node Voting
Node voting is the process by which users vote to select current block producers.

In order to vote, users must have staked ALA coins. Users are only able to vote if they have staked ALA. Users receive a voting weight of 1 vote per 1 ALA staked up to a maximum of 1000ALA.

Users can vote for up to 21 block producers simultaneously.

> Users receive voting rewards based off their block producer voting activity. The more they vote, and with higher weight, the more rewards they receive.

## Governance Voting
Outside of voting for BP's, users can also vote for governance proposals. Governance proposals are submitted by users and are how the community modifies the Alacrity protocol. A proposal can cover any aspect of the Alacrity blockchain and is the only way to modify the rules of the chain.

Governance voting takes place using the Electron app, and user vote weight is counted in a similar manner to node voting. A governance proposal requires 80% of all users who are staked to have a cast a vote, either yes or no. It also requires 70% of those proposals to be either yes or no to be counted as valid.

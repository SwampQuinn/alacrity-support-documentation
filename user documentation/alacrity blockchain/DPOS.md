# DPOS

## What DPOS Is
In order to maintain their decentralized state, Blockchains rely on algorithms that allow different nodes to reach consensus. Alacrity uses DPOS to achieve consensus as it provides meaningful advances in terms of speed and programmability.

## How DPOS Works
DPOS uses a set of permissioned nodes known as Block Producers (BPs) which are given the authority to maintain the blockchain and produce blocks. These BPs are rewarded in the form of ALA for their work maintain the chain.

BPs are elected by ALA owners through a voting system. Only elected BPs can produce blocks for the chain. This is different from other blockchains where any user can run a node. BP's perform all computation for the network and process all transactions. There are 21 main BPs at anytime on Alacrity and in order to maintain consensus these nodes must agree on the state of the ledger. The blockchain exists only through agreement between the nodes.

The network also employees nodes called Witnesses which can be thought of as back up BPs. In the event any BP would leave the network, Witnesses are standing by to take over.

## Why Use DPOS

DPOS is much more scalable in terms of transactions and computation. As Alacrity is focused on building a decentralized internet to process a universe of applications, scalability and computational capacity are key.

Because DPOS uses a smaller set of nodes, each transaction and computation becomes more efficient than networks that must replicate computations across thousands of nodes. It also allows each individual node to upgrade their equipment more regularly, promoting future scalability. 

## How Users Vote
Users vote by staking ALA coins and then selecting BPs they wish to elect.

## Staking
Staking is the process by which a user locks up ALA coins to be able to vote and earn rewards. The user still owns these coins but cannot use them until they are unstaked.

## How Often Votes Are Cast
Every block votes are cast.

## What Happens if a BP Doesn't Get Enough Votes
BPs must be continually elected and if at any point a given BP doesn't receive enough votes to be in the top 21, then they are removed from the BP role.

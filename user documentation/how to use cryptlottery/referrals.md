# Referrals

## How they work
Referrals are a big part of the cryptlottery system which promotes players inviting people to the platform. A referral can be made by inviting someone to a game. 

To do this:

### Direct Referral

When you refer someone to play a game and that person buys a ticket or multiple tickets, 5% of their purchase is sent to you as a reward. 

### Tree Referral

When you refer 2 or more people to a game you are added to the tree reward system under the last user added to the tree reward system. Referral tree positions are valid on a game by game basis.

## Tracking Earnings

All referrals will be paid out automatically. When exploring the Crypt Lottery's [Game History](https://cryptlottery.com/history) page, one can easily see these transactions.

It is also possible to see them in one's own Alacrity account by going to the ALA Wallet and viewing transaction history.

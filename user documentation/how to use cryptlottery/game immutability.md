# Game Immutability

Cryptlottery rather uses smart contracts to operate the games.

These smart contracts are coded to make their own decisions based on real-world input they receive. They can perform every task that earlier required manual operation, whether it is operating the games, taking bets, choosing winners, or sending out payments.

The inability to make any changes to smart contracts adds an additional layer of security and fairness to Cryptlottery.

# Auto Secret submission vs. Manual submission

Users can select to use the auto submission or the manual submission functions. Both are secure but using manual submission ensures your seed is submitted only at the time of reveal.

## Auto submission
Will occur automatically unless manual submission is selected.

## Manual submission 
Must be executed by selecting the manual option and submitting the seed via the CLI.

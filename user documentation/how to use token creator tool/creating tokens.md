# Creating Tokens

While Logged in on App.Alacritys, go to `Menu > Profile > My Tokens` and select `Create Token`

1. Fill in the Token Account - this must be lower case, without spaces, up to 12 characters, and should only contain a-z, 1-5. (subject to availability)

2. Assign a symbol for the token. This must have 3 - 7 Capital Case letters only. (also subject to availability)

3. Choose whether the token will be fungible or non-fungible. 
    * Fungible tokens are fully exchangeable with each other; while non-fungible tokens are unique instances. 
    * Each token is given a unique ID to distinguish it from others in the same token smart contract. 
    * A token always has an owner, and because each token is treated separately, their values can also be different.

4. If your token is Fungible, a Maximum Supply must be selected. This is the total supply of the Token which will exist This means that once the **maximum supply** is reached, there won't be any new coins mined, minted or produced in any other way.

5. Review and enter your account password once satisfied.

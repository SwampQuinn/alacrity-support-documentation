# Owner vs Active Keys

Think of an owner key as a master key, and an active key as a child key. Owners keys can create and change active keys which can be stored and used by nodes to provide additional security.

Owner keys can determine different levels of permissions for active keys, so that limited permission keys can be given to systems to use.

# Staking

The three resource types are `RAM`, `CPU` and `NET`. You can stake `CPU` and `NET`, and you can buy `RAM`. The economics of staking is also to verifiably commit to a promise that you'll hold the staked tokens, either for `NET` or `CPU`, for a pre-established period of time, in spite of inflation caused by minting new tokens in order to reward Block Producers for their services.

## Amount of ALA Staked for Each Function

<td><strong>Voters: </strong>
</td>
<td>Can choose to Stake ALA in order to receive part of the block reward. Each user can cast up to 1000 votes as long as they have at least 1000 ALA. If a user has more than 1000 ALA they can still only cast 1000 votes, but they will earn financial rewards on the total number of coins even if it exceeds 1000. In order to vote users must stake coins for at least 9 days.

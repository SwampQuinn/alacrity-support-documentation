# Transfer Request Link

Select the `request` button in the ALA wallet and the system will generate a request link that can be shared to any user on the internet.

The user generating the link selects the amount of ALA the request is for, and generates the link.

Upon receiving the link, the recipient is invited to pay the amount selected by the issuing user.

# Ram, Net & CPU

## RAM
RAM is the memory, the storage space, where the blockchain stores data. If your contract needs to store data on the blockchain, like in a database, then it can store it in the blockchain's RAM.

It is a network resource that users and developers must own and stake depending on the amount of network resources they use on the network. 

For the average user, the cost of this will be marginal.

## CPU
CPU as a resource is processing power, the amount of CPU an account has is measured in microseconds, it is referred to as cpu bandwidth on the platform and represents the amount of processing time an account has at its disposal when pushing actions to a contract.

CPU must be staked to perform most actions; a user must have a minimum of 0.5.

> NOTE: On signup user gets 0.5 staked cpu and 0.5 staked net.

## Net
As with CPU and RAM, NET is also a very important resource in blockchains.
 NET is the network bandwidth measured in bytes of transactions and it is referred to as net bandwidth on the platform.
 This resource, like CPU, must be staked so that a contract's transactions can be executed.

> NOTE: On signup user gets 0.5 staked cpu and 0.5 staked net.
